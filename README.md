# Hazel
Hazel Engine

## Important Note
This a Linux branch that repeats the code from the main branch. It's only meant to be used on Linux until the cross platform is implemented.

### Solution Manager
This solution is managed with CMake and not Premake.

### How To
To use this version of the engine clone it with the recursive option

`git clone -b linux-master --recursive https://github.com/S-Marais/Hazel.git HazelEngine`

This should download the sources of the engine and it's libraries into a HazelEngine folder
